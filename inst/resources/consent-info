`rJavaEnv`: Manage Java Environments for R Projects

Welcome to `rJavaEnv`! It looks like this is your first time using `rJavaEnv`.
This message will guide you through some of the key features and how `rJavaEnv` works.

`rJavaEnv` will manage Java Development Kits (JDKs) specifically for your R projects,
ensuring that each project uses the appropriate Java version
without affecting other projects or your system-wide Java installation.

Here's what `rJavaEnv` will do:

  - Create a 'rjavaenv' folder in your project/current working directory.
  - Generate necessary configuration files in the project/current working directory.
  - Update your $JAVA_HOME and $PATH variables within the current R session.

`rJavaEnv` will also update some existing files in your project/current working directory, such as:
  
  - .Rprofile

Additionally, `rJavaEnv` maintains a cache of Java distributions and installations at:

  - ${rJavaEnv_CACHE}

You can customize this path by setting the option `options(rJavaEnv.cache_path = 'path/to/your/java/cache')`.
Alternatively, you can set the cache folder as argument `cache_path` package functions that have option.
The same cache folder is used for both zipped java distributions and extracted distribution files.

For more information, read the introductory vignette with `vignette("rJavaEnv")` and browse the package documentation online at https://www.ekotov.pro/rJavaEnv/.

Whenever you install any `Java` JDK, kindly read the respective software license and agree to it before use.
For the current default JDK installed with rJavaEnv, which is Amazon Corretto, please find the license for the version
you are installing at https://github.com/corretto/.

Finally, if you are on a Linux system that did not have any 'Java' version previoulsy installed and you are not using pre-build 'R' package binaries (for example from 'Posit Package Manager') and instead install all 'R' packages from source, after this step you may have to quit R, follow these steps: https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/using-rjava/#reconfigure-r to set configure 'Java' for 'R', and only then install 'rJava', as otherwise 'rJava' cannot be built from source.
